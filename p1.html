            International Journal intended for professionals and researchers in all fields of computer 
            science and electronics. I have done the Call For Paper module, of online publishing, also 
            includes notifications about important dates for the submission of paper</p>

                this website is to exchange ideas in new emerging trends that needs more focus and exposure 
                and is always committed to publish articles that will strengthen the knowledge of upcoming 
                researchers and scientists. This project is implemented using JSP as the front-end and MySQL 
                as back-end</p>
                <p class="p1">In existed system, user can get all the details by checking through the website. User can find 
                    out all the information regarding the paper submission details in website. Fresher can also

                        curriculum allows the student flexibility in selecting courses and projects. Students, even at 
                        the undergraduate level, get to participate in on-going research and technology development –
                        an opportunity unprecedented in India.</p>
                        <p class="p3">Internships are generally thought of to be reserved for college students looking to gain 
                            experience in a particular field. However, a wide array of people can benefit from 
                            Training Internships in order to receive real world experience and develop their skills</p>
